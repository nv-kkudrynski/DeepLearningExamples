# ResNet50 v1.5 For MXNet

## Model overview
The ResNet50 v1.5 model is a modified version of the [original ResNet50 v1 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).

The difference between v1 and v1.5 is in the bottleneck blocks which require
downsampling. ResNet v1 has stride = 2 in the first 1x1 convolution, whereas
v1.5 has stride = 2 in the 3x3 convolution

This difference makes ResNet50 v1.5 slightly more accurate (~0.5% top1) than v1, but comes with a small performance drawback (~5% imgs/sec).

## Training procedure

### Optimizer

This model trains for 90 epochs, with the standard ResNet v1.5 setup:

* SGD with momentum (0.9)

* Learning rate = 0.1 for 256 batch size, for other batch sizes we linearly
scale the learning rate.

* Learning rate decay - multiply by 0.1 after 30, 60, and 80 epochs

* Linear warmup of the learning rate during first 5 epochs
according to [Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677).

* Weight decay: 1e-4

### Data Augmentation

During training, we perform the following augmentation techniques:
* Normalization
* Random resized crop to 224x224
* Scale from 5% to 100%
* Aspect ratio from 3/4 to 4/3
* Random horizontal flip

During inference, we perform the following augmentation techniques:
* Normalization
* Scale to 256x256
* Center crop to 224x224

See `data.py` for more info.

## Training using mixed precision with Tensor Cores

### Hardware requirements
Training with mixed precision on NVIDIA Tensor Cores, requires an NVIDIA Volta-based or Turing-based GPU.


### Software changes

For information about how to train using mixed precision, see the
[Mixed Precision Training paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740)
and
[Training With Mixed Precision documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html).


## Quick start guide

## Docker

To run docker MXNet container, run:

`nvidia-docker run --rm -it --ipc=host -v <path to source of this repo>:/workspace/resnet50 -v <path to prepared dataset>:/data/imagenet/train-val-recordio-passthrough nvcr.io/nvidia/mxnet:18.12-py3`

It will also automatically start downloading the MXNet container if you haven't downloaded it yet. You can also download it manually by running:

`nvidia-docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/mxnet:18.12-py3`

If you haven't prepared dataset yet (see section below), download raw ImageNet dataset (see section below), and run:

`nvidia-docker run --rm -it --ipc=host -v <path to source of this repo>:/workspace/resnet50 -v <path where prepared dataset should be created>:/data/imagenet/train-val-recordio-passthrough -v <path to raw dataset>:/data/imagenet/raw nvcr.io/nvidia/mxnet:18.12-py3`

and follow step from Prepare Dataset section.

## Prepare Dataset

The MXNet ResNet50 v1.5 script operates on ImageNet 1k, a widely popular image classification dataset from ILSVRC challenge.
You can download the images from http://image-net.org/download-images

The recommended data format is
[RecordIO](http://mxnet.io/architecture/note_data_loading.html), which
concatenates multiple examples into seekable binary files for better read
efficiency. MXNet provides a tool called `im2rec.py` located in the `/opt/mxnet/tools/` directory.
The tool converts individual images into `.rec` files.

To prepare RecordIO file containing ImageNet data, we first need to create .lst files
which consist of the labels and image paths. We assume that the original images were
downloaded to `/data/imagenet/raw/train-jpeg` and `/data/imagenet/raw/val-jpeg`.

```bash
python /opt/mxnet/tools/im2rec.py --list --recursive train /data/imagenet/raw/train-jpeg
python /opt/mxnet/tools/im2rec.py --list --recursive val /data/imagenet/raw/val-jpeg
```

Then we generate the `.rec` (RecordIO files with data) and `.idx` (indexes required by DALI
to speed up data loading) files. To obtain the best training accuracy
we do not preprocess the images when creating RecordIO file.

```bash
python /opt/mxnet/tools/im2rec.py --pass-through --num-thread 40 train /data/imagenet/raw/train-jpeg
python /opt/mxnet/tools/im2rec.py --pass-through --num-thread 40 val /data/imagenet/raw/val-jpeg
```
## Advanced

## Running training

To run training for a standard configuration (1/4/8 GPUs, FP16/FP32),
run one of the scripts in the `./examples` directory
called `./examples/RN50_{FP16, FP32}_{1, 4, 8}GPU.sh`.
By default the training scripts run the validation and save checkpoint after each epoch.
Checkpoints will be stored in `model-symbol.json` and `model-<number of epoch>.params` files.

If imagenet is mounted in the `/data/imagenet/train-val-recordio-passthrough` directory, you don't have to specify `--data-root` flag.

To run a non standard configuration use:

`./runner -n <number of gpus> -b <batch size per gpu> --data-root <path to imagenet> --dtype <float32 or float16> --model-prefix <model prefix>`

Checkpoints will be stored in `<model prefix>-symbol.json` and `<model prefix>-<number of epoch>.params` files.
To generate JSON report with performance and accuracy stats, use `--report <path to report>` flag (see `report.py` for info about JSON report file structure).
Use `./runner -h` and `python ./train.py -h` to obtain the list of available options.

## Running inference

To run inference on a checkpointed model run:
* For FP16
    `./examples/SCORE_FP16.sh <model prefix> <epoch>`
* For FP32
    `./examples/SCORE_FP32.sh <model prefix> <epoch>`

## Performance

## Benchmark scripts

To benchmark training and inference, run:

`python benchmark.py -n <numbers of gpus separated by comma> -b <batch sizes per gpu separated by comma> --data-root <path to imagenet> --dtype <float32 or float16> -o <path to benchmark report>`

To control benchmark length per epoch, use `-i` flag (defaults to 100 iterations).
To control number of epochs, use `-e` flag.
To control number of warmup epochs (epochs which are not taken into account), use `-w` flag.
To limit length of dataset, use `--num-examples` flag.
To benchmark only inference, use `--only-inference` flag.
By default, the same parameters as in `./runner` will be used. Additional flags will be passed to `./runner`.
